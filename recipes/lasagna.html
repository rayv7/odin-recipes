    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Prepare the meat sauce</strong>
            <p>
                Heat olive oil in a large pan over medium heat.

Add chopped onion and garlic, sauté until fragrant and soft.

Stir in ground beef (or beef/pork mix), cooking until browned.

Drain excess fat if needed, then add tomato sauce or crushed tomatoes and a spoon of tomato paste.

Season with basil, oregano, salt, pepper, and a pinch of sugar if the sauce tastes too acidic.

Let it simmer on low heat for about 20-30 minutes to deepen the flavor.

            <strong>Prepare the ricotta mixture</strong>
            <p>
                In a bowl, combine ricotta cheese with one beaten egg.

Add a handful of chopped fresh parsley, a pinch of salt, and a little Parmesan cheese. Mix well.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Cook the noodles</strong>
            <p>
                If using dried lasagna noodles, boil them until just tender (al dente), then drain and lay them flat on parchment or lightly oiled foil to prevent sticking.

If using oven-ready noodles, you can skip boiling. 
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Assemble the layers</strong>
            <p>
                In a baking dish, spread a thin layer of meat sauce on the bottom.

Add a layer of noodles, then spread some ricotta mixture on top, sprinkle mozzarella, and add more sauce.

Repeat the layers: noodles → ricotta → mozzarella → sauce, until ingredients are used up.

Finish with a final layer of noodles topped with meat sauce, mozzarella, and a generous sprinkle of Parmesan.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Bake the lasagna</strong>
            <p>
                Cover the dish loosely with foil (to prevent burning) and bake at 180°C (350°F) for about 30-40 minutes.

Remove the foil and bake for another 10-15 minutes until the top is bubbly and golden brown.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Rest and serve</strong>
            <p>
                Let the lasagna sit for at least 10-15 minutes after baking — this helps it set and makes slicing easier.

Slice into squares and serve warm.
